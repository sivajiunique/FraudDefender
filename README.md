# Credit Card Fraud Detection - README

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains anonymized transaction details from European cardholders, with the aim of identifying fraudulent transactions. Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost are used, with the model performance evaluated using various metrics.

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sivajiunique/FraudDefender.git
cd Credit_Card_fraud
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Model Training Script
```
python fraud_defender_model.py
```

## Model Details
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression , Decision Tree, Random Forest , XGBoost
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
- **Final Model Accuracy:** >75%

## Deployment Plan
The model can be deployed in a web application using Flask or FastAPI to detect fraud in real-time. It could also be integrated into a larger fraud detection system or API.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models such as Neural Networks to improve accuracy.
- Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.
- Integrate the system with an active fraud monitoring service.
